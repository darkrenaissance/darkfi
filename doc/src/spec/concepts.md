# Concepts

## Transactions

Each *transaction* is an atomic state update containing several *contract calls*
organized in a tree.

A *contract call* is the call data and function ID that calls a specific
*contract function*.
Additionally associated with each call are proofs and signatures that
can be verified in any order.

```rust
{{#include ../../../src/tx/mod.rs:transaction}}
```

```rust
{{#include ../../../src/sdk/src/tx.rs:contractcall}}
```

The tree of structure for contract calls corresponds to invocation semantics,
but with the entire callgraph unrolled ahead of time.

## WASM VM

*Host* refers to the context which loads and calls the WASM contract code.

Contracts are compiled WASM binary code. The WASM engine is a sandboxed
environment with limited access to the host.

*WASM exports* are functions exported from WASM and callable by the WASM engine.

## Contract Sections

Contract operation is defined by *sections*. Each contract section is only
allowed to call certain host functions.

**Example:** `exec()` may call `db_get()` but not `db_set()`, while `update()`
cannot call `db_get()`, but may call `db_set()`.

```rust
{{#include ../../../src/runtime/vm_runtime.rs:contract-section}}
```

| Host function     | Permission                     | Description                         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `db_init`         | Deploy                         | Create a new database               |
| `db_lookup`       | Deploy, Exec, Metadata, Update | Lookup a database handle by name    |
| `db_set`          | Deploy, Update                 | Set a value                         |
| `db_del`          | Deploy, Update                 | Remove a key                        |
| `db_get`          | Deploy, Exec, Metadata         | Read a value from a key             |
| `db_contains_key` | Deploy, Exec, Metadata, Update | Check if a given key exists         |
| `zkas_db_set`     | Deploy                         | Insert a new ZK circuit             |
| `merkle_add`      | Update                         | Add a leaf to a merkle tree         |
| `set_return_data` | Exec, Metadata                 | Used for returning data to the host |
| `get_slot`        | Deploy, Exec, Metadata         | Get the current slot                |

## Function IDs

Let $ùîΩ‚Çö$ be defined as in the section [Pallas and Vesta](crypto-schemes.md#pallas-and-vesta).

Functions can be specified using a tuple $\t{FuncId} := (ùîΩ‚Çö, ùîπ)$.
