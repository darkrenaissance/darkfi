# Deployooor

## Abstract

This contract enables deployment and management of custom smart
contracts on chain. Users can create an authority to control the smart
contract and deploy their custom `WASM` bincodes. Additionally, they
can update their code or lock the contract so its code is final and
can't be modified further.
