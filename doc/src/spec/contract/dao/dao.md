# DAO

## Abstract

This contract enables anonymous on chain DAOs which can make arbitrary contract calls.
In this system, holders of the governance token specified by the DAO can
make proposals which are then voted on. When proposals pass a specified
threshold they are finalized, then the proposal can be executed.
