# leadership burn proof

proof of burn of staked coin.

$$ X = (sn, ep, pk_x, pk_y, root, cm_x^{value}, cm_y^{value}) $$
$$ W = (value, ep, nonce, value_{blind}, sk, \tau ,path) $$
$$ \mathcal{L}= \{X:W\in \mathcal{R}\} $$

[^1]: if you read this after zerocash which crypsinous is based off, both papers calls nullifiers serial numbers. and serial number is nonce, `sn` in the table below can be called `nullifier` in our contract using zcash sapling terminology which is used in our money contract (sapling contract).
