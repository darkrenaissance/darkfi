# Writing ZK Proofs

ZK proofs in DarkFi are written in a simple low level
[DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domain-specific_language).
The zkas compiler then converts this human readable code into bytecode
that is run on the DarkFi ZKVM.

## Zkas Usage

To build zkas, run:
```
make zkas
```
We can then see the help output with `zkas -h`.

To compile a `.zk` file, simply run:
```
$ zkas proof/opcodes.zk
Wrote output to proof/opcodes.zk.bin
```
It's worth running `zkas -i proof/opcodes.zk` to get a sense of what
instructions the bytecode will send to the VM. We can also see the data
structure with `-e` as well.

## Structure of a ZK File

Take a look at existing ZK files in `proof/` directory for examples.

`k = ...` indicates the number of rows which is $2·µè$. Bigger values make
your proof slower, whereas if `k` is too low then the proof generation will
fail. Pick a value that works and find the minimum allowed. Usually 11 to 13
works.

`field = "pallas"` indicates the base field.

The `constant` section specifies any constants we use.

`witness` section contains the witnesses provided when generating the proof.

`circuit` specifies the actual instructions for the proof.

## Generating a ZK Proof in Rust

When compiling you will need to use the `zk` feature in cargo.
Check `tests/zkvm_opcodes.rs` for an example to follow along with.

The broad steps are:

1. Create your witness values, and put them in an array. The order must match
   what is set in the `.zk` file.
2. Calculate the public values from the private witnesses. This must be
   an array of the same type (usually `pallas::Base`).
3. Load the bytecode and generate the ZK proof.
4. Optionally you can verify it.

## Debugging ZK Files

The first thing you should do is export a JSON file to run with the debugger.
You can do this by adding this line into Rust.
```rust
zk::export_witness_json("witness.json", &prover_witnesses, &public_inputs);
```
Then after running the code, you should now have a file called `witness.json`.

Then run the ZK debugger.
```
./bin/zkrunner/zkrunner.py -w witness.json --prove --trace foo.zk
```
where `foo.zk` is our `.zk` file we're debugging.

Often this works, but the ZK proof is failing when used with a WASM contract.
In that case the culprit is that the WASM code is exporting the wrong
public values. Use the `msg!()` macro to print them to the program's output
log, and compare it with the public values you see in the `witness.json`
from when the proof was created. This will allow you to pinpoint exactly
where the error occurs.
