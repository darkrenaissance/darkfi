# Tau

Encrypted tasks management app using peer-to-peer network.  
Multiple users can collaborate by working on the same tasks, 
and all users will have synced tasks.


## Install 

```shell
% git clone https://github.com/darkrenaissance/darkfi 
% cd darkfi
% make BINS="taud"
```

If you want to have `taud` system wide:
```shell
% sudo make install BINS="taud"
```

And then run the daemon:
```shell
% taud
```

For the CLI part of `tau`, we use `tau-python`, you can run it with:
```shell
% cd bin/tau/tau-python
% python main.py
```
Or you can alias it by adding this line to your `bashrc`:
```shell
% alias tau=/path-to-darkfi/bin/tau/tau-python/main.py
```

### Quick start

#### Add tasks

Add a new task with the title "review tau usage" with the description text
"description" set to "review tau".

```bash
% tau add review tau usage desc:"review tau"
```

Add another task with the title "second task" assigned to dave.
Because no description is set, it will open your EDITOR and prompt you
for a description which allows entering multiline text.

```bash
% tau add second task @dave
```

```
% tau add Third task project:tau rank:1.1
% tau add Fourth task @dave project:tau due:1509 rank:2.5
% tau add Five
```


#### List tasks

```shell
% tau				# all non-stop tasks
% tau list			# all non-stop tasks
% tau 1-3			# tasks 1 to 3
% tau show state:open	# list open tasks
% tau rank:2			# all tasks that have rank 2
% tau @dave			# tasks that assign field is "dave"
```


#### Filtering tasks

Note: mod commands are: start, open, pause, stop and modify.

Note: All filters from the previous section could work with mod commands.

```shell
% tau 5 stop			# will stop task 5
% tau 1,3 start			# start 1 and 3
% tau 2 pause			# pause 2
% tau 2,4 modify due:2009	# edit due to September in tasks 2 and 4 
% tau 1-4 modify project:tau	# edit project to tau in tasks 1,2,3 and 4
% tau state:pause open		# open paused tasks
```

#### Comments

```shell
% tau 1 comment "content foo bar"	# will add a comment to task 1
% tau 3 comment				# will open the editor to write a comment
```

#### Export and Import

```shell
% tau export ~/example_dir	# will save tasks json files to the path
% tau import ~/example_dir	# will reload saved json files from the path
```

### archive

```shell
% tau archive                 # current month's completed tasks
% tau archive 1122            # completed tasks in Nov. 2022
% tau archive 1 1122          # show info of task by it's ID completed in Nov. 2022
```

#### Switch workspace

```shell
% tau switch darkfi	# darkfi workspace needs to be configured in config file
```

In addition to indexing tasks by there IDs, one can use their RefID (Reference ID):
```shell
% tau SjJ2OANxVIdLivItcrMplpOFbLWgzR
# or
% tau SjJ2OANxV
# or even
% tau SjJ
```

## Local Deployment

### Seed Node

First you must run a seed node. The seed node is a static host which nodes can
connect to when they first connect to the network. The `seed_session` simply
connects to a seed node and runs `protocol_seed`, which requests a list of
addresses from the seed node and disconnects straight after receiving them.

    # P2P accept addresses
    inbound=["127.0.0.1:11001"] 

Note that the above config doesn't specify an external address since the
seed node shouldn't be advertised in the list of connectable nodes. The seed
node does not participate as a normal node in the p2p network. It simply allows
new nodes to discover other nodes in the network during the bootstrapping phase.

### Inbound Node

This is a node accepting inbound connections on the network but which is not
making any outbound connections.

The external addresses are important and must be correct.

    # P2P accept addresses
    inbound=["127.0.0.1:11002"]
    
    # P2P external addresses
    external_addr=["127.0.0.1:11002"]

    # Seed nodes to connect to 
    seeds=["127.0.0.1:11001"]

### Outbound Node

This is a node which has 8 outbound connection slots and no inbound connections.
This means the node has 8 slots which will actively search for unique nodes to
connect to in the p2p network.

    # Connection slots
    outbound_connections=8

    # Seed nodes to connect to
