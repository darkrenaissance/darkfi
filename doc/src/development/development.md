Notes for developers
====================

## Making life easy for others

> **Write useful commit messages.**

If your commit is changing a specific module in the code and not
touching other parts of the codebase (as should be the case 99% of the
time), consider writing a useful commit message that also mentions
which module was changed.

For example, a message like:

> `added foo`

is not as clear as

> `crypto/keypair: Added foo method for Bar struct.`

Also keep in mind that commit messages can be longer than a single
line, so use it to your advantage to explain your commit and
intentions.

## ChangeLog

Whenever a major change or sub-project is completed, a summary must be noted
in the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/darkrenaissance/darkfi/blob/master/ChangeLog).
Think of this as a bulletin board where the rest of the team is notified of
important progress.

As we move through the stages, the current yyyy-mm-dd marker is updated with
the current date, and a new section above is created.

## cargo fmt pre-commit hook

To ensure every contributor uses the same code style, make sure
you run `cargo fmt` before committing. You can force yourself
to do this by creating a git `pre-commit` hook like the following:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
if ! cargo fmt -- --check >/dev/null; then
    echo "There are some code style issues. Run 'cargo fmt' to fix it."
    exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

Place this script in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and make sure it's
executable by running `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`.


## Testing crate features

Our library heavily depends on cargo _features_. Currently
there are more than 650 possible combinations of features to
build the library.  To ensure everything can always compile
and works, we can use a helper for `cargo` called
[`cargo hack`](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack).

The `Makefile` provided in the repository is already set up to use it,
so it's enough to install `cargo hack` and run `make check`.

## Etiquette

These are not hard and fast rules, but guidance for team members working together.
This allows us to coordinate more effectively.

| Abbrev  | Meaning            | Description                                                                                           |
|---------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| gm      | good morning       | Reporting in                                                                                          |
| gn      | good night         | Logging off for the day                                                                               |
| +++     | thumbs up          | Understood, makes sense                                                                               |
| afk*    | away from keyboard | Shutting down the computer so you will lose messages sent to you                                      |
| b*      | back               | Returning back after leaving                                                                          |
| brb     | be right back      | If you are in a meeting and need to leave for a few mins. For example, maybe you need to grab a book. |
| one sec | one second         | You need to search something on the web, or you are just doing the task (example: opening the file).  |

\* once we have proper syncing implemented in ircd, these will become less relevant and not needed.

Another option is to run your ircd inside a persistent tmux session, and never miss messages.

## Code coverage

You can run codecov tests of the codebase using
[`cargo-llvm-cov`](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov):

```
$ cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
$ make coverage
```

You can then find the reports in `target/llvm-cov/html/index.html`
