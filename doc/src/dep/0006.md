# DEP 0006: App Identifier for Version and Verack Messages

```
status: draft
```

## Motivation

Currently we use app version in `version` and `verack` messages to
check if two nodes can communicate during version exchange phase, but
this is not enough we need an app identifier to make sure two nodes
are running the same app over the p2p network.

This would be in addition to the magic bytes we use to identify p2p
networks as this human-readable info will make it easier to debug
connection issues.

## Proposal

Add the following field to Version and Verack Message

| Type                 | Description         | Comment        |
|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| `String`             | app_name            | App identifier |
