# Agorism Hackers Study Guide

During the 90s, the crypto-anarchists applied the emerging technology
of cryptography to create online zones encoded with the seed of
resistance. Cryptocurrency descends from that lineage, and lies at the
intersection of economics, politics and technology.

The agorists believed in leveraging economic power to create free and
democratic parallel societies.  We define revolution as a transformation
in the moral and political fabric of society. We can leverage crypto
technology for moral and poltical society and create encrypted free
zones online.

Money takes many forms, whether cash, credit, loans or debt. The
properties of money changes depending on its location, while measures like
interest rates and inflation obscure local differences.

The real source of power lies in economic networks. Money is a unit
of account between economic networks. By understanding economics, we
can use technological techniques to greatly influence the material and
political worlds and encode them with our values and philosophy.

## Methodology

Our critique of the student-teacher relation, where a teacher dictates a
course schedule to a student who has to learn the material, is as follows:

1. Students are not self led, and instead become reliant on an
   instructor, instead of developing independently.
2. Creativity is supressed since students do not explore and engage
   with knowledge in a dialectic way.

Instead we provide a system of mentorship. Everybody engages in study and
research inside the organization.  Subjects are not separated from one
another and we encourage people to read multiple subjects in a directed
way.  Our aim is to train leaders and raise people up.

Leaders must possess:

1. Strategic knowledge to be able to make strong macro analysis and
   direct activity.
2. Strong techncial skills to directly affect change themselves.

We emphasize a combination of both. Ideas should not gather dust in
books. We must put our ideas into action through practice. However,
blind undirected action is wasted effort. Therefore we seek to foster
both theory and practice in participants.

With the mentorship system, participants are self directed but are under
the influence of more senior mentors.  If they get stuck, they can
ask mentors for assistance to get past difficult concepts or discuss
ideas to gain a better understanding.  Learning through dialogue is
encouraged since it creates stronger bonds and relations between people
in the community.

## Progression

### Mandatory Initial Stage

Everybody in the organization must study philosophy and programming
as essential skills. To start there are two objects of study:

1. ["Manifesto for a Democratic Civilization"](https://agorism.dev/book/philosophy/1.civilization.pdf)
   by Ocalan, is 3 separate books. You should complete at least 1 book
   for the initial stage, and then study the other two as you continue
   further into later stages.
2. ["Project Based Python Programming"](https://agorism.dev/book/python/Eric%20Matthes%20-%20Python%20Crash%20Course%20A%20Hands-On%2C%20Project-Based%20Introduction%20to%20Programming%20%282016%2C%20No%20Starch%20Press%29.pdf)
   this will teach you Python programming which will be an essential
   skill for any branch you decide to continue onto.

Programming takes time and dedication to become proficient at. Many people
give up during the initial phase which can take more than a year. You
have to push through it. Once you master programming, it becomes enjoyable
and fun. Code is the medium of our organization. We are hacker-artists.

### Branches

All branches take roughly the same time to become highly proficient in:
around 1-2 years. Even after 6 months, participants can begin using
their acquired knowledge in a practical way with small limited tasks. We
actively encourage the combination of theory and practice to strengthen
one another.

#### Token Scientist

Token engineering is a new emerging science. Tokens are a breakthrough
in building online networks, since we have a means to engineer
incentive mechanisms and encourage certain user behaviours.

DeFi protocols in crypto make extensive use of token engineering to
design how liquidity flows in and out of networks, and is an important
key part of leveraging cryptoeconomic power.

To become proficient in this area requires study of economics,
mathematics, and finance. It also makes heavy use of Python programming
to build simulations and economic models.

1. ["New Paradigm for Macroeconomics"](https://agorism.dev/book/economy/Richard%20A.%20Werner%20%28auth.%29%20-%20New%20Paradigm%20in%20Macroeconomics_%20Solving%20the%20Riddle%20of%20Japanese%20Macroeconomic%20Performance-Palgrave%20Macmillan%20UK%20%282005%29.pdf) by Werner. This book will take several months to study but is a strong basis for understanding economics.
    1. Notes from the [introduction](https://wiki.polytech.barcelona/index.php?title=Notes/New_Paradigm_in_Macroeconomics/Introduction) to Werner's book.
    2. [Notes](https://wiki.polytech.barcelona/index.php?title=Notes/Werner) on 'Shifting from Central Planning to a Decentralized Economy
2. ["Understanding Pure Mathematics"](https://agorism.dev/book/math/intro/A.%20J.%20Sadler%2C%20D.W.S.Thorning%20-%20Understanding%20Pure%20Mathematics%20%281987%2C%20Oxford%20Up%20Education%29.pdf). We have a full high school mathematics course. This can also be skipped if you already know maths well.
    1. Continuing on with mathematics, you can learn more about stochastics, statistics, probability and analysis.
3. [The DeFi and Token Engineering book](https://agorism.dev/book/economy/Economics%20and%20Math%20of%20Token%20Engineering%20and%20DeFiV1.1.pdf).

#### Software Developer

Software developers create the end result software that others
use. They take research and create a product from that research
by applying the ideas.  Developers can further be focused more on
creating prototypes from research, or developing prototypes into
polished final products.

To become a senior developer means learning about how the computer
works on a deep level, and learning advanced programming skills.
It takes time to fully master with a lot of early frustration but
is eventually highly rewarding and creative.  Developers are highly
sought after and rare.

1. Learn from various materials about computer architecture, operating systems, and software architecture.
    1. Books such as the history of UNIX or the mythical man month.
    2. Articles by [hintjens.com](http://hintjens.com/blog:19)
2. [Rust programming book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
3. [Install Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide), learn to use the terminal

#### Cryptography Researcher

Cryptography researchers craft the weapons or implements of change
that developers use.  They use advanced algebra to exploit the hard
limits set by the universe on reality and craft cryptographic schemas
that obey certain properties. They are in a sense reality-hackers. They
hack reality to create systems that obey objective properties due to
the underlying mathematics.

Cryptography researchers create mathematics and repurpose existing
algorithms in their schemas. Needless to say, the advanced cryptographer
is a good mathematician.

For cryptography, you will study ["Abstract Algebra"](https://agorism.dev/book/math/algebra/%28Dover%20Books%20on%20Mathematics%29%20Charles%20C%20Pinter%20-%20A%20Book%20of%20Abstract%20Algebra-Dover%20Publications%20%282010%29.pdf) by Pinter, and starting with simple cryptographic schemes
gradually move towards learning more complex ones. You will prototype
these schemes using a computer algebra system called
[SAGE](https://doc.sagemath.org/pdf/en/a_tour_of_sage/a_tour_of_sage.pdf).

#### Protocol Engineer

Good knowledge of computer science fundamentals as well as the ability
to write code. Algebra studies are also required but not to the same
degree as cryptography.

The protocol engineer is responsible for blockchain consensus algorithms,
developing p2p networks, and other forms of distributed synchronization
such as CRDTs. They establish the fundamentals for creating distributed
applications and hardening the censorship-resistant properties of
crypto. They also harden networks against de-anonymization attempts
through the use of encrypted mixnetworking and other techniques.

Protocol engineers have to possess a good knowledge about the theory
behind distributed networks, as well as experience in how they work in
practice. This topic is part theory, part practical. They must have a
good grasp of algorithms and computer science theory.

#### Other

Alongside this study, continuing to study Ocalan is required. After
finishing the Ocalan texts, you can then read Werner's book on
economics, as well as Mumford or other philosophers.
