# Hiring Process

Follow this guide to work on DarkFi and get paid.

If you're not a dev, see the [learn] section. We offer mentoring.
Anybody can become a dev. It's not that hard, you just need focus and dedication.

[learn]: ../learn.md

## Criteria

We don't care about qualifications, only about code. Even if you're new, if you
show initiative, leadership and the ability to adapt, then you have a strong
chance.

## Join the Community

Get onto the [DarkIRC chat] where the core community is. Every Monday
there's a core dev meet at 14:00 UTC (DST) or 15.00 (ST). You can
introduce yourself there to make yourself known and discuss which part
of the code you'd like to get involved in.

Then you should run [tau] which is our task manager. The `darkfi-dev` workspace
has a list of open tasks.

Also see the [contribute] page.

We are not spending time on social media or proprietary chats like Telegram
because we're very busy.

## Send an Email (optional)

You can send an email to `hiring@dark.fi` to introduce yourself. This step is
entirely optional and we respect people's privacy. If you can also drop a
message in `#dev` then that's helpful.

From here we can setup a private group on the chat. Then you can follow up in
the group with any specific questions.

## Make a Commit

To be hired as a dev, you must make commits to the repo, preferably more than
minor cosmetic changes. It also is useful to have online repositories
containing your work. We don't care about degrees or qualifications -
many of the best coders don't have any.

Every candidate must make a decent commit that gets merged. We are available to
help people do this by guiding them. But this is a hard prerequisite, and helps
us see people can actually write code. It's the only thing we care about.

## Onboarding

Finally here we discuss specifics. You will have been assigned a team leader who
will arrange with you the details.

We offer fully anon employment. Make sure you make an
[anon account on codeberg][codeberg-anon] over Tor, and also connect to the
DarkIRC chat over Tor too. You can even make an anon email with
[onionmail.org](https://onionmail.org) to email us with. We pay in Monero (XMR)
or stablecoin USDT. You are responsible for any legal obligations incurred by
your host country.

We value people who have initiative. We value this so highly in fact that even
if someone is less skilled but shows the ability to learn, we will welcome them
and give them everything they need to prosper. Our philosophy is that of
training leaders rather than hiring workers. Our team is self-led. We don't
have any managers or busybody people. We discuss the problems amongst ourselves
and everybody works autonomously on tasks. We don't keep people around who need
a manager looking over their shoulder. The work and tasks should be obvious, but
to help you along below you will find lists of tasks to get started on.

### Trial

For the initial phase, there is a 3-month trial where you can be terminated at
any time with a 2-week notice.

We ask candidates to draft a short document which contains:

* Tangible deliverables that will be completed.
* Any areas you want to focus on.

It does not have to be long, and can be a short bullet list. At the conclusion
of the trial, you will be evaluated against this document.

During the trial, candidates have an assigned mentor to assist with guiding
work. We also encourage people to attend the weekly Monday dev chat and propose
topics to discuss.
