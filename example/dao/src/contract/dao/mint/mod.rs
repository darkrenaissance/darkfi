/// This is an anonymous contract function that mutates the internal DAO state.
///
/// Corresponds to `mint(proposer_limit, quorum, approval_ratio, dao_pubkey, dao_blind)`
///
/// The prover creates a `Builder`, which then constructs the `Tx` that the verifier can
/// check using `state_transition()`.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `proposer_limit` - Number of governance tokens that holder must possess in order to
///   propose a new vote.
/// * `quorum` - Number of minimum votes that must be met for a proposal to pass.
/// * `approval_ratio` - Ratio of winning to total votes for a proposal to pass.
/// * `gov_token_id` - Governance Token ID
/// * `dao_pubkey` - Public key of the DAO for permissioned access. This can also be
///   shared publicly if you want a full decentralized DAO.
/// * `dao_blind` - Blinding factor for the DAO bulla.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// let dao_proposer_limit = 110;
/// let dao_quorum = 110;
/// let dao_approval_ratio = 2;
///
/// let builder = dao_contract::Mint::Builder(
///     dao_proposer_limit,
///     dao_quorum,
///     dao_approval_ratio,
///     gov_token_id,
///     dao_pubkey,
///     dao_blind
/// );
/// let tx = builder.build();
