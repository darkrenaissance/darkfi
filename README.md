## Build

#### NOTE: Use the v0.0.1 git tag if you want to try out the software.

This project requires the Rust compiler to be installed. 
Please visit https://rustup.rs/ for instructions.

The following dependencies are also required:

|          Dependency          |  Debian-based   |   
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| gcc, gcc-c++, kernel headers | build-essential | 
| clang                        | clang           | 
| clang libs                   | libclang-dev    | 
| llvm libs                    | llvm-dev        | 
| udev libs                    | libudev-dev     |
| pkg-config                   | pkg-config      | 
| wget                         | wget            | 

Users of Debian-based systems (e.g. Ubuntu) can simply run the following 
to install the required dependencies:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential clang libclang-dev llvm-dev libudev-dev pkg-config
```

To build the necessary binaries, we can just clone the repo, and use the 
provided Makefile to build the project. This will download the trusted 
setup params, and compile the source code.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/darkrenaissance/darkfi
$ make
```

## Install

This will install the binaries and configurations in the configured
namespace (`/usr/local` by default). The configurations are installed
as TOML files in `/usr/local/share/doc/darkfi`. They have to be copied
in your user's `$HOME/.config/darkfi` directory. You can review the
installed config files, but the defaults should be good for using
the testnet if you're following this document.

```
$ sudo make install
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/darkfi
$ cp -f /usr/local/share/doc/darkfi/*.toml ~/.config/darkfi
```

## Bash Completion
This will add the options auto completion of `drk` and `darkfid`.
```
echo source $(pwd)'/auto-complete' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage

After the installation, you should have `drk` and `darkfid`
binaries in `/usr/local`. Also, the configuration files should be in
`~/.config/darkfi`. Now we're ready to use the testnet.

In one terminal, start `darkfid`, which is the daemon that will
communicate with the DarkFi network:

```
$ darkfid -v
```

And in the other terminal, we can use the CLI interface to `darkfid`
called `drk`:

```
$ drk -h
drk

USAGE:
    drk [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information
    -v, --verbose    Increase verbosity

OPTIONS:
    -c, --config <CONFIG>    Sets a custom config file

SUBCOMMANDS:
    deposit     Deposit clear tokens for Dark tokens
    features    Show what features the cashier supports
    hello       Say hello to the RPC
    help        Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    id          Get hexidecimal ID for token symbol
    transfer    Transfer Dark tokens to address
    wallet      Wallet operations
    withdraw    Withdraw Dark tokens for clear tokens
```

### Examples

See [doc/tutorial.md](doc/tutorial.md).

## Code Formatting

```
cargo +nightly fmt
cargo clippy
```
Try `cargo +nightly clippy --fix --all-features -Z unstable-options` to let clippy autofix some lints.

## Go Dark

Let's liberate people from the claws of big tech and create the
democratic paradigm of technology.

Self-defense is integral to any organism's survival and growth.

Power to the minuteman.
