/// Seed sync session creates a connection to the seed nodes specified in settings.
/// A new seed sync session is created every time we call p2p::start(). The seed
/// sync session loops through all the configured seeds and tries to connect to
/// them using a Connector. Seed sync either connects successfully,
/// fails with an error or times out.
///
/// If a seed node connects successfully, it runs a version exchange protocol,
/// stores the channel in the p2p list of channels, and disconnects, removing
/// the channel from the channel list.
///
/// The channel is registered using Session trait method, register_channel().
/// This invokes the Protocol Registry method attach(). Usually this returns a
/// list of protocols that we loop through and start. In this case, attach()
/// uses the bitflag selector to identify seed sessions and exclude them.
///
/// The version exchange occurs inside register_channel(). We create a handshake
/// task that runs the version exchange with the function
/// perform_handshake_protocols(). This runs the version exchange protocol,
/// stores the channel in the p2p list of channels, and subscribes to a stop
/// signal.
