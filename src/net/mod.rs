/// Message Subsystem maintains a list of dispatchers, which is a generalized
/// version of a subscriber. Pub-sub is called on dispatchers through the

/// generic message is called a payload and is processed and decoded by the
/// Message Dispatcher.

/// trait called Message Dispatcher Interface, which allows us to process any
/// kind of payload as a message.

/// continually get address and get-address messages to inform each other
