/// necessary db and trees, and give back what it has. This means that
/// on subsequent runs, our native contracts will already be in a deployed
/// state, so what we actually do here is a redeployment. This kind of
/// operation should only modify the contract's state in case it wasn't
/// deployed before (meaning the initial run). Otherwise, it shouldn't
/// touch anything, or just potentially update the db schemas or whatever
/// is necessary. This logic should be handled in the init function of
/// the actual contract, so make sure the native contracts handle this well.
