//! This module implements the client-side API for this contract's interaction.
//! What we basically do here is implement an API that creates the necessary
//! structures and is able to export them to create a DarkFi transaction
//! object that can be broadcasted to the network.
//!
//! Note that this API does not involve any wallet interaction, but only takes
//! the necessary objects provided by the caller. This is intentional, so we
//! are able to abstract away any wallet interfaces to client implementations.
