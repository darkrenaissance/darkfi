#| # Evaluation Representation of Polynomials and FFT optimizations
#| In addition to the coefficient-based representation of polynomials used
#| in babysnark.py, for performance we will also use an alternative
#| representation where the polynomial is evaluated at a fixed set of points.
#| Some operations, like multiplication and division, are significantly more
#| efficient in this form.
#| We can use FFT-based tools for efficiently converting
#| between coefficient and evaluation representation.
#|
#| This library provides:
#|  - Fast fourier transform for finite fields
#|  - Interpolation and evaluation using FFT
