# dnet

A simple tui to explore darkfi p2p network topology. Displays:

1. Active p2p nodes
2. Outgoing, incoming, manual and seed sessions
3. Each associated connection and recent messages.

`dnet` is based on the design-pattern Model, View, Controller. We create
a logical seperation between the underlying data structure or Model;
the ui rendering aspect which is the View; and the Controller or game
engine that makes everything run.

## Run

### Using a venv

Depending on your setup you may need to install a virtual environment
for Python. Do so as follows:

```shell
% python -m venv python-venv
% python-env/bin/activate
```

Then install the requirements:

```shell
% python-venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run dnet:

```shell
% python-venv/bin/python main.py
```

### Without a venv

If you don't require a venv, install the requirements and run dnet as follows:

```shell
% pip install -r requirements.txt
% python main.py
```

## Usage

Navigate up and down using the arrow keys. Type `q` to quit.

## Config

The `dnet` config file can be found in `bin/dnet/config.toml`. Enter the
RPC ports of the nodes you want to connect to and title them as you see
fit. The default config file uses localhost, but you can replace this
with hostnames or external IP addresses. You must also specify whether
it is a `NORMAL` or a `LILITH` node.

## Logging

dnet creates a log file in `bin/dnet/dnet.log`. To see json data and
other debug info, tail the file like so:

```shell
tail -f dnet.log
```
