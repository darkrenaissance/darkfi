/// Adds a temporary workaround for [an issue] with the Rust compiler and Android when
/// compiling sqlite3 bundled C code.
///
/// The Android NDK used to include `libgcc` for unwind support (which is required by Rust
/// among others). From NDK r23, `libgcc` is removed, replaced by LLVM's `libunwind`.
/// However, `libgcc` was ambiently providing other compiler builtins, one of which we
/// require: `__extenddftf2` for software floating-point emulation. This is used by SQLite
/// (via the `rusqlite` crate), which defines a `LONGDOUBLE_TYPE` type as `long double`.
///
/// Rust uses a `compiler-builtins` crate that does not provide `__extenddftf2` because
/// it involves floating-point types that are not supported by Rust.
///
/// The workaround comes from [this Mozilla PR]: we tell Cargo to statically link the
/// builtins from the Clang runtime provided inside the NDK, to provide this symbol.
///
/// See also this [zcash issue] and [their workaround].
///
/// [an issue]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/109717
/// [this Mozilla PR]: https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5442
/// [unsupported]: https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-builtins#unimplemented-functions
