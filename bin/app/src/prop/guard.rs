/// This schedules all property updates to happen at the end of the scope.
/// We can therefore have fine-grained control about when property updates are
/// propagated to the rest of the scenegraph.
///
/// This way we avoid triggering draw updates mid draw, and changes are atomic.
/// For example resizing the content view, will trigger the editbox background to
/// redraw while a current window wide draw is in progress. Since the window draw
/// triggered the change when we submit the draw update, it will be discarded by
/// the editbox bg triggered update. However this update won't have the current
/// rect and will be stale.
///
/// 1. Content draw starts
/// 2. Dependent property triggers and submits editbox bg redraw.
/// 3. Content draw continues and now draws editbox bg with updated rect.
/// 4. Finished content draw's editbox bg update is discarded in favour of #2.
///    However #2 used the pre-updated rect and is now stale.
///
/// We solve the above issue by batching all updates until after the draw call is finished.
/// This also has the unintended side-effect of making draws much faster since they aren't
/// interrupted halfway through by extra compute.
