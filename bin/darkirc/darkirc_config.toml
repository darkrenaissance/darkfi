## ====================
## IRC channel settings
## ====================
##
## You can create a shared secret with `darkirc --gen-secret`.
## Never share this secret over unencrypted channels or with someone
## who you do not want to be able to read all the channel messages.
## Use it like this example:
#[channel."#foo"]
#secret = "7CkVuFgwTUpJn5Sv67Q3fyEDpa28yrSeL5Hg2GqQ4jfM"
#topic = "My secret channel"

[channel."#dev"]
topic = "DarkFi Development HQ"

[channel."#media"]
topic = "DarkFi Art, Fashion, Video, Memetics"

[channel."#markets"]
topic = "Crypto Market Talk"

[channel."#math"]
topic = "Math Talk"

[channel."#memes"]
topic = "DarkFi Meme Reality"

[channel."#philosophy"]
topic = "Philosophy Discussions"

[channel."#random"]
topic = "/b/"

[channel."#lunardao"]
topic = "LunarDAO talk"

## ================
## Contact settings
## ================
##
## In this section we configure our contacts and people we want to
## have encrypted DMs with. Your contacts' public keys should be
## retrieved manually. Whenever this is changed, you can send a
## SIGHUP signal to the running darkirc instance to reload these.
##
## The secret key used to decrypt direct messages sent to your public
## key (the counterpart to this secret key).
## It is also recommended to paste the public key here as a comment in
## order to be able to easily reference it for sharing.
##
## You can generate a keypair with: darkirc --gen-chacha-keypair
## and replace the secret key below with the generated one.
## **You should never share this secret key with anyone**
#[crypto]
#dm_chacha_secret = "AKfyoKxnHb8smqP2zt9BVvXkcN7pm9GnqqyuYRmxmWtR"

## This is where you put other people's public keys. The format is:
## [contact."nickname"]. "nickname" can be anything you want.
## This is how they will appear in your IRC client when they send you a DM.
##
## Example (set as many as you want):
#[contact."satoshi"]
#dm_chacha_public = "C9vC6HNDfGQofWCapZfQK5MkV1JR8Cct839RDUCqbDGK"
#
#[contact."anon"]
#dm_chacha_public = "7iTddcopP2pkvszFjbFUr7MwTcMSKZkYP6zUan22pxfX"
