## Key Features
- **DarkFi Blockchain Synchronization**: Ensures real-time synchronization of blockchain data, providing an accurate and unified view of DarkFi activity across supported networks.
- **Blockchain Data Exploration**: Access detailed information about blocks and transactions.
- **Gas Analytics**: Analyze gas usage metrics at both the network level and on a per-transaction basis.
- **Native Contract Source Code Access**: Review the implementation details of native contract source code for improved transparency.
- **Search Blocks and Transactions**: Locate specific blocks or transactions using search.

## Network Status

The testnet and mainnet configurations serve as placeholders in preparation for their respective launch. When starting environment with these environment configurations , the site will connect to an Explorer Node that point to their respective darkfid networks, but currently only display the network's genesis block.

In addition, testnet and mainnet configurations are currently using development servers for the site and work is ongoing for production-like setups.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:
- **Rust 1.86 or later**: For building and running the explorer daemon (`explorerd`).
- **Make**: To start and stop explorer environments using make
- **Python 3.12**: Required for running the Explorer Site (`site`).
- **Darkfi Project Dependencies**: Dependencies required to compile the Darkfi code. For more details, see [Darkfi Build Dependencies](../../README.md#build).
- **Darkfid**: Required for running DarkFi blockchain nodes on respective networks. The make commands build the binary from source code in `../darkfid` (if not already built in project root) and apply the appropriate network configuration.
- **Minerd**: Needed for setups where Darkfid is configured with a miner JSON-RPC endpoint, but the configured miner is not running on the desired network. The make commands build the binary from source code in `../minerd` (if not already built in project root) and apply the appropriate network configuration.

## Quick Start Guide

Run the following to get explorer environments running, including explorer nodes and site to view blocks on the respective Darkfid configured networks. These commands will automatically install dependencies, configure your environment, and start all necessary components.

### Start Localnet Explorer Environment

```sh
# Launch an explorer environment using the localnet configuration  
make start-localnet
```

### Start Testnet Explorer Environment

```sh
# Launch an explorer environment using the latest testnet configuration 
make start-testnet
```

### Start Mainnet Explorer Environment

```sh
# Launch an explorer environment using the latest mainnet configuration 
make start-mainnet
```

> Once started, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to access the explorer interface.

### Stopping the Explorer Environment

#### Ctrl-C
To stop the environment, press the keyboard combination Ctrl-C and wait for all components to stop.

#### Make Command
You can also stop the environment using Make:
```sh
# Stop the running explorer environment (nodes and site)
make stop
```

### Getting Help
```shell
make help
```

## Explorer Components

### Explorer Nodes

DarkFi explorers rely on explorer nodes who are responsible for syncing with DarkFi blockchain networks. Explorer nodes function as background daemons, running continuously to ensure the Explorer database stays up-to-date. They synchronize with the latest blocks during startup and actively listen for new blocks using DarkFi's subscription interface. This ensures that the Explorer provides an accurate and consistent view of blockchain activity. Explorer nodes are implemented in Rust, designed to reliably handle real-world blockchain changes, including reorganizations (reorgs) and block updates, while maintaining data integrity.

For more details on explorer nodes and their functionality, see [explorerd/README.md](explorerd/README.md).

### Explorer Site

The Explorer Site is a web application that serves as the user interface for viewing DarkFi blockchain data. It provides an interactive way for users to explore blockchain information, analyze gas usage, and navigate contract source code. The site connects to explorer nodes to fetch real-time data, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information is provided.

For more details on the Explorer Site, see [site/README.md](site/README.md).

## Configuration

### Configuration Files

The Explorer uses configuration files to define `darkfid` endpoints for block synchronization, `explorerd` endpoints for retrieving blockchain data, and other settings such as log file locations. These configurations can be reviewed and updated as needed.

| Configuration File | Description                                                                                                              |
| --- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **[Darkfid Config](../darkfid/darkfid_config.toml)** | Contains darkfid network configurations for `localnet`, `testnet`, and `mainnet`.                                        |
| **[Explorerd Config](./explorerd/explorerd_config.toml)** | Specifies the `darkfid` endpoint for block synchronization and the `explorerd` endpoint for retrieving synchronized data. |
| **[ExplorerSite Config](./site/site_config.toml)** | Defines the `explorerd` endpoints for fetching synchronized data, as well as other settings for the Explorer site.|

### Supported Networks
The Explorer is configured to support the following pre-configured DarkFi blockchain networks.

| **Network**    | **Description**                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`localnet`** | Ideal for development and testing in a local environment using `darkfid`'s localnet configuration. |
| **`testnet`**  | Used for testing the explorer with `darkfid`'s testnet network (pending availability). |
| **`mainnet`**  | The production environment for running the explorer on DarkFi's canonical chain (pending availability). |

> **Note**: Once the testnet and mainnet are fully available, the explorer will sync more than just the genesis blocks for these networks.
