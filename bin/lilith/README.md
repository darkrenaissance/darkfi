lilith
==========

A tool to deploy multiple P2P network seed nodes for darkfi applications, in a single daemon.

## Usage

```
lilith 0.3.0
Daemon that spawns P2P seeds

USAGE:
    lilith [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information
    -v               Increase verbosity (-vvv supported)

OPTIONS:
    -c, --config <config>    Configuration file to use
        --url <url>          Daemon published url, common for all enabled networks [default: tcp://127.0.0.1]
```

On first execution, daemon will create default config file ~/.config/darkfi/lilith_config.toml.
Configuration must be verified, and application networks should be configured accordingly.

Run lilith as follows:
