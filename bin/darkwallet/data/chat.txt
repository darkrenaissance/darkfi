00:53 bouma would you call within a 75% CI weak evidence ? i would call it no evidence
01:00 somiaj I don't think a p value of 0.25 is that common, most prefer 0.05 or smaller
01:34 PlanckWalk Ci width has little to do with evidence strength.
02:19 KZ-Spectra hello
02:34 KZ-Spectra so when impose periodicity, then I want that also to be the case
02:35 KZ-Spectra "Find the remainder when 9 x 99 x 999  x ... x 99....9 (999 9s) is divided by 1000"
02:43 Z-module so the last factor there is 10^999 - 1 ?
03:01 KZ-Spectra yeah
03:02 KZ-Spectra it's the flavor of mod arithmetic since that's what we have been doing :)
03:08 KZ-Spectra Z-module:  I'll give you the end answer: 109
03:09 KZ-Spectra Z-module: https://i.imgur.com/vTstSUO.png can we just do this?
03:13 PlanckWalk yeah, 9*99*999^997 = 891*(-1) = 109 (mod 1000)
03:15 KZ-Spectra oh no
03:19 PlanckWalk Err, superscripts
03:20 PlanckWalk No
03:21 PlanckWalk It looks like it stands alone
03:22 PlanckWalk There are possible questions of conditional convergence, though.
03:23 KZ-Spectra those u's are complex
03:24 PlanckWalk So *if* the RHS is defined, it is equal to the LHS.
03:25 PlanckWalk No idea, I haven't read through the mathbin at all.
03:26 PlanckWalk (and probably won't since I'm just in a tea break at work)
06:12 Hasdiel Does anyone know of a good self-hosted open source alternative to wolfram alpha?
07:18 Pelleplutt In a fictive world. Tell me how one human male and ten human females would repopulate an deserted island in the fastest way. How many years would it take for the population to reach 1 million with unlimited food supply, pre-build shelters and enough space. Take in to calculation that a human female cannot reproduce until 13 years old on average and
07:36 greenbagels Pelleplutt: interesting problem for a boss to give their employees lol
07:37 Pelleplutt greenbagels indeed :) He has been playing around with AI but i do not know why this question came from that
07:43 isekaijin Pelleplutt: Is your boss a weeb or what? What the hell is with that plot?
07:43 greenbagels Pelleplutt: how old are the original people?
07:44 greenbagels no i mean in the problem
07:44 Pelleplutt oh, good question. We can assume they are above 13 and below 40
08:00 Pelleplutt I guess we have to assume that its 50% males and 50% females that is born aswell
08:15 PlanckWalk With lots of simplifying assumptions, of course.
08:16 PlanckWalk Proabbly the most annoying relevant one would be reduced fertility with age.
08:18 PlanckWalk Inbreeding would be definitely a concern, but make a lot less difference than pretty much any other assumptions.
08:19 PlanckWalk But basically the boss will either give you a cake or not, on his whims.  There isn't a true "correct answer" to this.
08:25 PlanckWalk (If only 3.4% die before 40 on this isolated island with no pre-existing civilization then it's a fucking miracle)
08:29 PlanckWalk Anyway, maybe try asking on worldbuilding.stackexchange.com or something :-p
08:30 PlanckWalk Because it sounds like the premise for some crappy harem litrpg.
08:33 Pelleplutt Assumtion is that there is no inbreeding problem aswell :P
09:30 PlanckWalk Pelleplutt: Then eh, if you take off every sane limit like that then you could probably do it in just over a century.
09:32 PlanckWalk (The stated mortality rates are irrelevant, and shouldn't even have been mentioned)
10:03 mh_le morning all
10:06 biberao hi
10:29 sigma1 is T := { {}, {{}} } transitive?
10:30 Inline vertically not, horizontally maybe
10:33 mh_le sigma1: what is the definition of "transitive" in this sense?
10:34 sigma1 is each element of the set is a subset of the set
10:35 mh_le if would help if you were a bit more precise
10:36 sigma1 A set H is transitive if every one of its elements is a subset.
10:37 mh_le then yes
10:40 sigma1 and T := { {}, {{}}, {{{}}} } ?
10:41 lericson we went through this, sigma1
10:47 biberao math time
10:48 mh_le which kind?
10:50 biberao mh_le: i did some trig and sequences yesterday night
10:51 machinewhore Is there a collection of urn problems/solutions somewhere that I can use for practice?
10:52 mh_le you mean counting/probability problems?
10:53 mh_le https://www.google.com/search?q=counting+and+probability+problems&oq=counting+and+probability&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCAgCEAAYFhgeMgYIABBFGDkyBwgBEAAYgAQyCAgCEAAYFhgeMggIAxAAGBYYHjIICAQQABgWGB4yCAgFEAAYFhgeMggIBhAAGBYYHjIICAcQABgWGB4yCAgIEAAYFhgeMggICRAAGBYYHtIBCDcwNTJqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
10:58 sigma1 I'm not sure whether these are transitive T: = {∅, {{∅}} and S:= {∅, {{∅}}, {∅}} I get confused with the ∅
10:59 machinewhore S is transitive iff each element of S is a subset of S.
11:01 sigma1 it'd be T: = {∅, {{∅}} btw
11:02 machinewhore If you answer those two questions I asked, then you will know if T is transitive or not.
11:03 mh_le biberao: ah cool
11:07 machinewhore sigma1: Figure it out?
11:12 sigma1 machinewhore the set {{∅}} is a subset of T, because its element is part of T
11:13 PlanckWalk Its element is {∅}
11:14 PlanckWalk The elements of T are ∅ and {{∅}}
11:16 machinewhore Yup, those are the elements of T.
11:23 mh_le biberao: is a solution to an assignment you are typesetting?
11:24 biberao yes
11:25 mh_le ok, I don't know spanish so I'm not sure I will be able to help
11:26 biberao but the issue is structuring i wanted to make it similar
11:27 biberao mh_le: i want to be able to have like exercice 1 and so on
11:31 sigma1 PlanckWalk so T is transitive as ∅ is a subset of T
11:33 sigma1 and the members of {{ø}} is only {ø}, and {ø} is a subset of A
11:35 PlanckWalk That's not the test for transitivity
11:36 sigma1 yes
11:37 machinewhore What is the definition of "subset'?
11:38 sigma1 If B is a set whose elements are included in a set A we say that B is included in A or that B subset of A
11:39 PlanckWalk As you did!
11:40 PlanckWalk So try again without using the word "included".
11:41 sigma1 'part of a set A' instead of that
11:44 PlanckWalk Try looking up a definition.
11:45 PlanckWalk The one you're using is broken.
11:48 machinewhore42 sigma1: Are you a native English speaker?
11:50 sigma1 A is a subset of B, if and only if every element of A is an element of B
11:51 PlanckWalk I severy element of {{ø}} an element of T?
11:53 PlanckWalk What are the elements of {{ø}}?
11:54 sigma1 the set {ø}
11:55 sigma1 the set {ø}  and ø
11:57 sigma1 err the other should be {{ø}}
11:58 PlanckWalk Which other?
11:59 sigma1 {{ø}} and ø
12:00 PlanckWalk Right, so now you can answer whether T is transitive.
12:01 mh_le Let B - i -> B' - p -> B'' be an exact sequence of left R-modules, and let A be a right R-module and consider the maps id_A (X) i and id_A (X) p then (id_A (X) p) \circ (id_A (X) i) = id_A (X) 0, but why is this the zero map?
12:06 mh_le here 0 must be the map b \mapsto i(b)\mapto p(i(b))=0 for all b in B, but the Id_A is not zero
12:07 mh_le wait
12:11 sigma1 is U\T transitive?
12:12 mh_le r( a (X) b) = (ar (x) b) = (a (x) rb). so ( a (x) 0) = 0
12:13 mh_le that's not right
12:20 -- Mode ##math [+o int-e] by ChanServ
12:28 mh_le so it was pretty obvious that a (x) 0 = 0
13:56 sigma1 the text asks me whether U \ T is transitive
13:58 int-e Cool. What are U and T?
14:21 biberao Z-module: ?
14:22 brass_ Can the sine function be achieved using finite combination of the basic operations?
14:24 dTal No, sine is transcendental
14:25 dTal Why do you ask?
15:33 paulo https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=y%5E2%3D%28x%28x-9%29%28x%2B16%29%29%2C+y+%3D+3
15:34 paulo why are solutions shown as complex when the line clearly intersects the graph in real space?
16:12 brass_ dTal Can I message you privately, I can't respond here.
16:12 dTal You can't?
16:13 brass_ ?Yup ok, it's just that what I might say may sound too dumb on an elementary level.
16:27 ecraven hello ;) I'm looking for a function that does the following: I know N (the number of items) and i (the index of the current pick). I'd like to go from i=0..N-1, and get back a "random" ordering (so not 0, 1, 2, ... but 5, 7, 23, 1, ...) where each number from 0 to N-1 occurs exactly once for i=0..N-1.
16:30 Z-module paulo: putting y = 3 in that and working with the resulting equation  x^3 + 7x^2 - 144x - 9,  I get (if I haven't made an error) the discriminant to be 13133457, which (being positive) means there are three distinct real roots. *Somehow* the particular numbers are fouling up the floating-point solvers. Notice how very minuscule all those imaginary parts are.
16:32 mh_le hey all
16:34 ecraven and it works fine, I just implemented it wrong ;)
17:05 biberao Z-module: tell me what you think https://github.com/gitmapd/gitmapd.github.io/blob/master/limites%20nova%20ficha.pdf <- finished exercise 2 and 3
17:14 Z-module Looks good, biberao
17:16 biberao Z-module: ive added another thing to prove bounded for 3-2n
17:19 Z-module I think you mean 3 - 2/n
17:20 biberao i did lim n (3-2n) = -inf
17:22 Z-module Take any real r (of any sign).  Then  3 - 2n < r   iff   (3 - r)/2 < n     , so for all n > (3 - r)/2, that holds.  This is the meaning of  lim (3 - 2n) = -infty
17:23 biberao maybe i should use the delta epsilon?
17:27 Z-module That's what this is, but in the form used for sequences
17:28 Z-module A sequence {b_n} goes to +infty if:  Forall r   exists M   forall n > M    b_n > r         Change that last > to < and you get the form for -> -infty
17:31 mh_le hi Z-module
17:33 Z-module This reminds me of a very neat thing. Let g_n mean (the (n+1)st prime) - (the nth prime), the nth prime gap. It turns out we don't need really heavy analytic number theory for the following: merely the pretty basic (easier-to-prove than you might think) Chebyshev bounds suffice, and I think only one side of it is even enough:  Infinitely many n exist with  g_n < g_(n+1) > g_(n+2),  also infinitely many with  g_n > g_(n+1) < g_(n+2).
17:52 biberao back
17:53 biberao Z-module: thank you
17:56 theseb Can someone tell me how they got the "observed power" on this A/B test calculator? https://abtestguide.com/calc/
17:57 theseb "two proportions hypothesis testing"
18:05 biberao Z-module: so for example if an = 3-2n was a monotonic increasing i could do  an > M
18:06 Z-module by the way, a sequence can -> +infty without being monotonic or eventually monotonic. For example: 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6 ...
18:07 biberao for this case is this right to say 1 < 3-2n < -inf
18:07 Z-module However, that prime gaps sequence {g_n}, while unbounded, does not -> infty, as we've only known with proof for around a decade.
18:08 Z-module nothing is < -infty
18:08 biberao but you understood what i meant
18:09 Z-module okay but  -infty < any reals you like,  so there's no point writing that. Finitely many innequalities have nothing to do with -> -infty
18:18 biberao Exercise 2 d)
18:26 Z-module I don't think you need to check or mention that 1 > every a_n at all. Simply the fact that eventually all a_n are < any pre-selected number is enough to get that the sequence is not bounded. Also you shouldn't write  lim a_n = -infty    at the top like that: only write it after showing it to be true.
18:27 Z-module the  1 > all a_n   would be relevant if you were dealing with "unbounded only on one side" as a separate / special case of "unbounded".
18:37 Z-module {b_n} is "bounded" iff some positive r exists with |b_n| < r  (same as:  -r < b_n < r )   for all n.  Equivalent to saying some reals r < s exist with  r < b_n < s  for all n.      The negation of this, {b_n} unbounded, is:  EITHER:   for every r, for infinitely many n,  r < b_n   (that's unbounded above),  OR:   for every r, for infinitely many n,  r > b_n   (unbounded below).  Or both.
18:39 Z-module But unbounded above is weaker than {b_n} -> +infty ; unbounded below is weaker than {b_n} -> -infty.  The sequence 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, ...  is unbounded above, but does not -> +infty.
18:44 biberao Z-module: so thats the way we did earlier then
18:47 biberao ok gtg
18:48 greenbagels another happy customer
19:11 mh_le hi
19:12 mh_le any progres on Wald?
19:39 Simplar I'm having issues with elementary problem. I want to find out how to prove that even divided by odd is always even if the divisor divides dividend. I know that even number has 2 among the multiples, while odd number never does, so the two won't go anywhere.
19:57 Z-module Simplar:  2m - (2n + 1) = 2(m - n) - 1 = 2(m - n - 1) + 1   and this last is odd.
20:09 Simplar Z-module: I meant (2m) / (2n+1)
20:10 Simplar 2m = (2n+1)q + r
20:13 Guest5398 Hello, sorry, If you have 7 Characters and every 1 day Chance of Birth is 1%, how can i create a function that will Tell me the amount of Characters after n days?
20:24 Z-module Simplar: The question presupposes that the numerator n = 2m is an integer multiple of the denominator d where d is odd. So 2m = kd  for some k. So  2m/d = k,  and k can't be odd because then d, also being odd, would mean  kd  is also odd, not true since kd = 2m.
20:25 Z-module also, note taht "difference" referes to the - operator, not the / operator
20:28 Z-module Simplar: another way to put that.  2m = kd  and prime factoriation is unique (up to order), so 2 appears somewhere in the prime factorization of kd.  But it's not in d, so it must be in k. So  2m/d = k  is even.
20:33 Guest5398 Its Like having seven dollars and getting 1% interest? Having 7 Characters having a Baby at 1% Chance . That should be IT.
20:35 pavonia Guest5398: What is the relation between characters and birth here?
20:36 Guest5398 I mean Characters can increase by 1 at a 1% Chance per one Character per day
20:42 mahboubine basic question: I've calculated the derivative of some function f, then I was asked to calculate f'(x) at some point c. I did this and the result was an undetermined form (5/0) where do I move from there?
20:43 pavonia Guest5398: I guess it's a matter of definition if the chance after N days is 0.01*N or (1.01)^N
20:46 serveee why is topology so hard to understand
20:47 Galois it's a lot easier if you know real analysis well
20:48 Galois metric spaces are already an abstraction of Euclidean space, and one which is useful in many ways, but abstracting to open and closed sets is a perfectly natural next step, and that gives you topology
21:17 Z-module mahboubine: what's your f, and your c ?  f might not actually be differentiable at c
21:20 mh_le Z-module: pm?
21:33 mahboubine I was overthinking the whole thing
