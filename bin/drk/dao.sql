-- # DAO::mint()
-- 
-- First one person will create the DAO
--
--   $ drk dao create_dao \
--       PROPOSER_LIMIT \
--       QUORUM \
--       APPROVAL_RATIO_BASE \
--       APPROVAL_RATIO_QUOTIENT \
--       GOV_TOKEN_ID > dao.dat
--
-- dat.dat contains:
--
-- * DAO parameters as listed above
-- * secret key for the DAO
-- * bulla blind
--
-- We can view the data like so:
--
--   $ drk dao view_dao < dao.dat
--
-- Now everyone inside the DAO exchanges dao.dat out of band will import
-- it into their wallets.
--
--   $ drk dao import_dao DAO_NAME < dao.dat
--   Imported DAO ccb8XXX8af6
--
-- Where ccb8XXX8af6 is the DAO's bulla.
--
-- Next one person will mint it on chain
--
--   $ drk dao mint DAO_NAME
--   Broadcasted DAO ccb8XXX8af6
--
-- And then the others will receive confirmation that the DAO they imported
-- into their wallet has also been accepted on chain.

-- # Minting and Receiving Coin
--
-- Assume that the governance tokens have been created and distributed
-- appropriately among DAO members. We will skip that part here.
--
-- Now the DAO can receive coins into its treasury. These coins simply
-- have both the coin's spend_hook and user_data fields set correctly
-- otherwise they are rejected as invalid/malformed.

-- # DAO::propose()
--
-- Create a proposal for the DAO
--
--   $ drk dao propose \
--       DAO_NAME \
--       RECV_PUBKEY \
--       AMOUNT \
--       SERIAL \
--       SENDCOIN_TOKEN_ID
--
-- If we don't have enough tokens to meet the proposer_limit threshold
-- then this call will simply fail with an error message. Nothing will
-- be added to the database or sent to the network.
--
-- The other participants should automatically receive the proposal
-- ready to vote on it.

-- # DAO::vote()
--
-- You have received a proposal which is active. You can now vote on it.
--
--   $ drk dao proposals DAO_NAME

--   DAO quorum threshold: Z
--   DAO approval ratio: 60%
--
--   $ drk dao vote 1 yes

-- # DAO::exec()
--
-- Once there are enough yes votes to satisfy the quorum and approval ratio,
-- then any DAO member can execute the payment out of the treasury.
--
--   $ drk dao exec 1
--
-- FUTURE NOTE: We have to assume that 2 people could try to exec at once.
--              So if our exec fails, then the tx fee we pay should be returned
--              to our wallet.
--              We should design our tables for exec accordingly.
--              For now I didn't put anything, but we should keep this minor
--              point in mind and ruminate on it for later.
