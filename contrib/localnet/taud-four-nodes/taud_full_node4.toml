## Workspace settings
## ====================
##
## You can create a shared secret (read_key) with `taud --generate`.
## Never share this secret over unencrypted channels or with someone
## who you do not want to be able to read all the workspace's tasks.
## The write_public_key is used to verify task's authenticity the admin 
## of workspace should generate and share it, while write_key is the 
## private part and responsible for signing tasks and gaining write 
## access, this, too, should not be shared with someone you don't 
## want to add/edit tasks.
## Use it like this example:
#[workspace."foo"]
#read_key = "2bCqQTd8BJgeUzH7JQELZxjQuWS8aCmXZ9C6w7ktNS1v"
#write_public_key = "Fgsc8tep4KX3Rb2drq8RxMyrHFWQ7wZaZPpF9F3GQYFG"
#write_key = ""

[workspace."test"]
read_key = "AXApLyi8id3T1MwKkrgdYZtkpUag5qMmambDHGkdFiY2"
# write_key = "7jvrj4Rxnm1UcAjz5Y1CNFEfZiGMg9F1ekfbbEakkicA"
