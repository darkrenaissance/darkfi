darkfid localnet
================

This will start one `darkfid` node in localnet mode,
along with a `minerd` daemon to mine blocks.

If we want to test wallet stuff, we must generate
a testing wallet and pass its address to the `darkfid`
config, so the wallet gets the block rewards the node
produces. We generate a wallet, set it as the default
and set its address as the `recipient` field in
`darkfid.toml`, using the porvided automated script:
```
% ./init-wallet.sh
```

Then start `darkfid` and wait until its initialized:
```
% ./tmux_sessions.sh
```

After some blocks have been generated we
will see some `DRK` in our test wallet.
```
% ./wallet-balance.sh
```

See the user guide in the book for more info.

## Wallet testing

Here is a table of all the `drk` stuff that needs to be tested to verify
wallet and node functionalities work as expected, based on the current
testnet user guide.
Note: List is not exhaustive. Missing functionalities that are not part
of the guide can be added for future regressions.
